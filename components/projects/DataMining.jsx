                &emsp;Network optimization is a significant topic of current
                computer science and computer engineering study. In this course
                project, I have created a network routing protocol utilizing the
                data structures and algorithms learned in class CSE629 Analysis
                of Algorithms. This allowed me to transform my academic
                understanding into a real-world practical computer application.
                This module features random sparse and dense graph generation,
                and implementation of Dijkstra’s and Kruskal’s algorithms to
                solve the maximum bandwidth problem. In the end, I have

                &emsp;The goal of this project is to help us realize that
                translating algorithmic notions at a higher degree of
                abstraction into tangible implementations in a specific
                programming language is not always straightforward.
                Implementations usually urge you to focus on extra details of
                the techniques, which can result in significantly more
                knowledge. We concentrate on the Maximum Bandwidth Path problem,
                which is considered a significant network optimization
                challenge. Various techniques may be used to find the path with
                the best potential bandwidth between a given source and
                destination, but the performance is mainly dependent on the
                actual implementation of an algorithm and the data structures
                utilized beneath. First, we build two random weighted undirected
                graphs, one sparse and one dense with a large degree of
                vertices. We maintain this generation unpredictable enough to
                adequately assess the performance of methods. Furthermore, we
                employ two well-known algorithms - Dijkstra’s and Kruskal’s - to
                determine the maximum bandwidth path between the source and
                destination. However, we conduct a comprehensive examination of
                the running time of these algorithms after modifying them to use
                the heap sort rather than not utilizing one. In the later parts
                of this report, I go over the specifics of random graph
                generation, implementation of Dijkstra’s without heap algorithm,
                Dijkstra’s with heap algorithm, and Kruskal’s algorithm.
                Finally, I present the results in tabular format as well as a
                thorough performance comparison of these three routing
                algorithms.

                &emsp;I build these random graphs in two parts. Firstly, each
                vertex is connected to its next vertex thus forming a cycle to
                ensure that graph has only one strongly connected component. For
                example, V0 is connected to V1 and V4999, V2 is connected to V1
                and V3 and so on. After this step, each vertex will have a
                degree of two which results in a total edge count of 5000. In
                the second part, we randomly pick two vertices and add an edge
                if there isn’t already existing one, and increase the degree of
                both vertices. We keep repeating this process until the average
                degree of the vertex is reached the target degree which is 6 in
                the case of the sparse graph and 1000 for the dense one. This
                results in the generation of random graphs having approximately
                15000 edges for the sparse graph and 2.5 million for the dense
                graph. I record the graph generation time and print the average
                vertex degree (as calculated below) for the sparse graph and the
                average percentage of adjacent vertices connected in for the
                dense graph.

                &emsp;Because both graphs are weighted, when I create an edge
                between any two vertices, I apply a random edge weight
                (generated by the Random library from the java.util package)
                with a weight limit of 20000. I tried numerous settings for this
                weight limit option, rang- ing from 10 to 50,000. Because the
                Random library was producing a random integer (not a float), the
                number of buckets for the dense network was relatively smaller
                for the lower weight limit, resulting in saturating the maximum
                bandwidth to the weight limit (a possible solution to this was
                to generate the weights as floats, ensuring enough buckets in
                order to prevent saturation). When I upped the weight limit to
                20000, the maximum bandwidth obtained from the algorithms for
                the dense graphs was about 19000.

                &emsp;This is the most important aspect of the project. After
                generating the random graphs, we now will apply various routing
                algorithms to discover the maximum bandwidth path between a
                given source node s and destination node t. We must implement
                three routing algorithms: Dijkstra’s without the heap,
                Dijkstra’s with the heap structure (which was explained in the
                previous section) to efficiently sort the fringes, and Kruskal’s
                algorithm, which involves generating a maximum spanning tree
                (MST) and then finding the path by applying Depth First Search
                on the source vertex. We then evaluate their performance based
                on the running time of these algorithms. The next subsections
                will go into the implementation details of these algorithms. I
                have maintained a separate folder in the repository for creating
                three different classes for each algorithm, which implements the
                apply method which takes the Graph, source, and destination as
                algorithms.

                &emsp;Dijkstra’s algorithm is usually used to solve the shortest
                path problem in a graph, which can be modified to solve the
                maximum bandwidth problem as well. It is a greedy approach to
                finding the fringe with maximum bandwidth and is guaranteed to
                find the optimal maximum bandwidth path for the graphs having
                all positive edges. The implementation is highly derived from
                the pseudo-code provided in the class. To keep track of the
                multiple stages during algorithm processing, we employ three
                arrays: parent, status, and bw. I built the Status enum, which
                comprises three vertex states: UNSEEN, FRINGE, and INTREE. We
                begin by setting the status array to UNSEEN and filling the
                fringes from the source vertex. We iterate till the fringes
                exists and then choose the fringe with the most bandwidth,
                change its status to INTREE, and update its bandwidth in the bw
                array. In the end, the bandwidth array will contain the maximum
                bandwidth for all the vertices, and following the parent array,
                we can find the path which gives us the maximum bandwidth. Then
                we just print the node which eventually results in the reverse
                route from source to destination. Because we are keeping track
                of the fringes in an array, we will need to cycle over the whole
                array to determine the largest fringe, forcing the total
                Dijkstra algorithm to execute in O(n2) time. This can be
                improved by using the heap sort which is explained in the next
                section

                &emsp;In this modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm, instead
                of traversing throughout the fringes, we use VertexHeap (defined
                above) to maintain the fringe with the highest bandwidth. We
                first initialize the VertexHeap with a size equal to the number
                of nodes in the graph by calling the init() method. Then we
                start from the source node and insert its neighbors to the heap,
                thus turning their status from UNSEEN to FRINGE. We then fetch
                the fringe with maximum vertex (in constant time) by calling the
                popMax() method at index 0 (remember the heap will store the
                fringe with maximum bandwidth at the top). Once retrieved, we
                remove it from the fringes array and update its status from
                FRINGE to INTREE. Then we repeat this process from the maximum
                fringe, looking at its neighbors and so on. The actual

                far more than the number of vertices. A fascinating result is
                obtained in the case of Kruskal’s running time complexity. For

                performs the poorest in dense graphs, and HeapSort accounts for
                the majority of the time consumption. This component of the
                implementation might be enhanced using a different sorting
                mechanism. One of the biggest concerns is Kruskal’s reliance on
                the number of edges, which means that the more edges there are,
                the slower this implementation runs. If another sorting approach
                (one example would be Radix sort) could sort over the edges
                faster, the implementation could perform better. The amount of
                improvement that might be made is debatable, but even decreasing
                it to be equivalent to Dijkstra’s different implementations
                would be advantageous.

                &emsp;Overall, we were able to successfully design three
                alternative strategies for addressing the network optimization
                problem of calculating the maximum bandwidth path. As a result,
                we were able to assess the performance of each of these
                algorithms on sparse and dense networks. According to the
                findings, Dijkstra’s method with a heap took the least amount of
                time to execute and hence performed best for both types of
                graphs. The next section goes into great detail about the code
                structure and how to run it.
